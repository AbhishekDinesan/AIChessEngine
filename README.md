# Chess Engine using Aritificial Intelligence

Playable Chess Engine using Minimax Search-Tree Algorithm &amp; Alpha-Beta Pruning

## How does this work?

There are three main components to this project
1. Building Chess
2. Evaluation
3. Minimax Search Tree
4. Optimization Strategies

## Building Chess

In a group, I was asked to build a functioning chess game for one of our CS courses. This would feature a "set-up" mode where you could add/drop pieces, player vs player chess games, and a very simple player vs computer game (no real intelligene, mostly generated random moves). Our group used object oriented software principles to develop the basic functionality of the chess board.

Since this project needed to be finished on a deadline, it was poorly constructed. I took apart the code, refactored it, and removed a lot of the functionality and decided to focus simply on human vs computer games, and wanted to construct the hardest computer level I could.

## Evaluation

An important problem you face when developing an engine is evaluation of a given position. Essentially, what defines a favourable position on the chess board?
To compute this, I used these evaluation matrixes from this community,
